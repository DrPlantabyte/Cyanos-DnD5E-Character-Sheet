This character sheet is intended to be printed as two double-sided sheets. The equipment page (the back side of the first page) uses slightly modified rules for encumbrance based on equipment slots rather than total weight carried.

Pg1-A and Pg1-B are the front and back of the first page, respectively.

Pg2-A and Pg2-B are the front and back of the second page, respectively. Only character who cast spells need this page.
