# DrCyano's D&D 5E Character Sheet
This is a two-page (double-sided) character sheet designed to help solve common issues that periodically occur during my D&D games (such as "What is my spell save DC again?", "Is this a concentration spell?", and "How are you carrying all that?"). This character sheet features math reminders and helpful check-boxes, as well as a tweaked encumbrance system that should make carrying equipment more fun and require less book-keeping.

## Instructions
Download the PDF from the releases page and print it such that the first two pages of the PDF are on the front and back of sheet 1 and the second two pages are the front and back of sheet 2 (double-sided printing). 

## New Encumbrance System
The goal of the new encumbrance system, described in the box on the bottom of page 1B (back-side of the first sheet), is two-fold: **A)** Encourage the players to think about how they carry their equipment, and **B)** make encumbrance rules enforcable without using a calculator to add up the weight of all items.

This new system works as follows: A character's strength score determines how many equipment slots are available for holding items. Each slot has a weight limit and most slots can only hold 1 item. The characters are allowed to violate these restrictions, but doing so makes them encumbered. There's a special *trinkets* inventory for small items of inconsequential size and weight, but again, a character can only stuff so many in their pockets before it affects their ability to defend themself.

The underlying logic of this system is that adventurers are generally encumbered by the lop-sided balance and physical bulk of their items, not the absolute weight. Thus the equipment slots represent what a person could reasonably keep at the ready without unbalancing them to the point of being vulnerable in a moment of danger. The strength requirements for the slots are calibrated to roughly match the total weight limits presented in the Player's Handbook.

Encourage players who find these limits too restricting to have their character purchase a pack animal to carry their goods for them (this is why pack-animals were invented, after all).

## Notes
This character sheet is intended to be printed as two double-sided sheets. The equipment page (the back side of the first page) uses slightly modified rules for encumbrance based on equipment slots rather than total weight carried.

Pg1-A and Pg1-B are the front and back of the first sheet, respectively.

Pg2-A and Pg2-B are the front and back of the second sheet, respectively. Only character who cast spells need this sheet.
